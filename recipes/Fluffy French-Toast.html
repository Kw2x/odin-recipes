    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This is the best French toast recipe. It's different because it uses flour. I have given it to some friends and they've all liked it better than the French toast they usually make!</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>12 thick slices bread</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure flour into a large mixing bowl. Slowly whisk in milk. Whisk in eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Soak bread slices in milk mixture until saturated.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, cook bread on the preheated griddle or pan until golden brown on each side. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
