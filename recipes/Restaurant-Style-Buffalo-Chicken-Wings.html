   <p>
     <p>Fry the Wings</p>

     Fry the chicken wings in a skillet filled with oil heated to 375 degrees F. Remove the wings and place them on a paper-towel lined plate to remove the excess oil.

     Drizzle the hot wings sauce over the fried wings or place the hot wings in a bowl with the sauce and mix together until combined.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground paprika</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>10 chicken wings</li>
      <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
      <li>¼ cup butter</li>
      <li>¼ cup hot sauce</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Whisk together flour, paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt in a small bowl.</li>
      <li>Place chicken wings in a single layer in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle flour mixture over top and toss until wings are evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
      <li>Add about 1 inch oil to a deep, heavy skillet; heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). (The oil should be just enough to cover wings entirely.)</li>
      <li>While the oil is coming to temperature, combine butter, hot sauce, pepper, and garlic powder in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook and stir until butter is melted and mixture is thoroughly blended.</li>
      <li>Fry coated wings in the hot oil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they begin to crisp and turn brown. Maintain the oil temperature while cooking.</li>
      <li>Remove wings from the oil and place on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
      <li>Transfer wings to a platter and drizzle hot sauce over top; or mix wings and hot sauce in a bowl until coated. Serve.</li>
