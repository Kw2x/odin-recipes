        <p> Best Potatoes for Potato Wedges
            Opt for a starchy potato variety, such as russet potatoes or Yukon Golds, for perfect results. Avoid waxy potatoes, such as fingerlings, as they won't hold up as well during cooking. 
        </p>
        <p> How to Cut Potato Wedges
            To cut a potato into wedges, slice the potato in half lengthwise. Place the cut side of the potato onto the cutting board and cut it in half again to create quarters. 
            Repeat with the other half. Now, position each potato quarter with the cut side up and cut down the center of each quarter to create a wedge. Repeat with the other quarters until the entire potato is cut into wedges.

        <p> How to Make Potato Wedges
            You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:
            
            Seasoned potato wedges are placed in the basket of an air fryer and cooked for 10 minutes. The wedges are flipped with tongs and cooked for an additional five minutes, to ensure maximum crispiness. 
            
            This recipe doesn't require pre-soaking the potato wedges before air frying. However, if you have time to soak the potatoes in cold water for about 30 minutes before seasoning and "frying," the recipe might yield even crispier results.

        <p> How Long to Cook Potato Wedges In the Air Fryer
            These potato wedges should be perfectly crispy after about 15 minutes (10 minutes on one side, five minutes on the other). If you feel like your wedges aren't crispy enough, you can air fry them for a bit longer on each side — just make sure they don't burn.
